% gaussian filter is often used for image processing, it can efficiently
% decrease the noise which was distributed as gaussian function. Assuming
% that A is the original image and B is the image after gaussian filtering,
% we can say that every point in B is calculated by the average of the
% point in A as well as the points surrounding them.
